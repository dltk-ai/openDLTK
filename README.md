# OpenDLTK


This Repo contains all the widely used Machine Learning Techniques for Classification, Regression & Clustering,Computer Vision & Natural Language Processing
as Docker Images

This repo contains docker-compose files corresponding to all the Open sourced Docker Images corresponding to ML, Computer Vision & NLP. 
Using these Docker Images developers can make faster AI-enabled prototypes or even production level products.

The development of DLTK is sponsored by QubitAI.

## Introduction 

You can deploy all the open-sourced docker images using docker-compose files provided in this repository
